# rollup-words

To generate a wordcloud, prepare an anvironment, activate it, and run
the program:

    ./prepare.sh
    . ve/bin/activate
    ./words.py

There is lots of random numbers involved, so keep generating until it
looks good.  More words could probably be added (and maybe some should
be removed).
